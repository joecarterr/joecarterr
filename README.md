Hey there 👋,
I'm a very new programmer who has almost always been highly interetsed programming just never really fully committed to doing it.

- 👀 I’ve almost always been interested in Software Engineering and Automation of tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python aswell as a little Java
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking for any sort of group work or anything i'm just teaching myself. However, any help is greatly appreciated!

Under here I have some projects I have made previously so please take a look if you're interested!
