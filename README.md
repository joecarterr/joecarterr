Hey there 👋,
I'm a very new programmer who has almost always been highly interetse di programming/ computers just never really fully committed to doing it.
I'm going to be using this GitHub account in order to see others programs mainly and to help me improve overall.

- 👀 I’ve almost always been interested in Software Engineering and Automation of tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python aswell as a little Java
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking for any sort of group work or anything i'm just teaching myself. However, any help is greatly appreciated!
